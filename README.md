This is an Individual Project done by me in 5 days. My project was to clone the website of Apple.com. Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue. I created a basic flow of the website. The pages I have shown are:- **1. Index Page, 2.Store, Mac, Watch,iPad,iPhone Pages, 3. Sign-Up Page,4.Login Page, 5.Cart page, 6. Checkout page. 6. Track Your Order with Location Page, 7. filter, sort, and search functionality added.**

I have used localStorage for the functionality of login page. The Landing page is the Index Page when Log in is Succesfull, where you can see the different product shown on that you can apply filter and sorting operation together. In the Navbar section you can click on the Login button which will open a Sign-up Page if your are a new user on our website so you have sign-up first, you can't use same **Email** again for creating Account. After creating New account you will automatically redirected to Log in page within a 3 seconds. Where you can use UserName as your register Email id: - **rushikeshbhomale@gmail.com** and password that given at the time of sign-up as -**Rushi@789** to login in the page, after succesfull Log in you will redirected to index page automatically. If you enter any wrong information in Login page in it will not show you Wrong Email or Password...

Then clicking on the any option present on navbar you will redierected that category products page where you can different products shown. I have shown filtering functionality on the right side where you can filter based on price & Category of products. At a time you can filter the products based on one selected filtering option. You can Sort the product based on the Price low to high and Price high to low. As well as you can use filter and sort functionality both toghether on products. Then on ever product one button is there which you can use to add the product to the cart.

In the Cart page you can find the products you added. I have provided a functionality to remove the products from the cartpage, You can see total Number of Products present in your cart on upper-left side of cart page & also you can see total price of products present in your cart. You can increase the number of item count or decrease the count by given "+" & "-" button below product quantity in cart. In the further page you just have to add the details like in Checkout page you have to add your delivery address and click on the submit t will show if your order is placed or not. If your cart is Empty and you try to checkout on submit of details it will show you "Your Cart is Empty". After 5 seconds it will redirect you the homepage i.e Index Page. 

If you want to see your product details and want to track your order with it location you have to just visit checkout page there is option "Track your order." on that track order you can search your order by your Name, Pin Code, item name, and Mobile Number.

Thank You...
